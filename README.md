Call Center Dashboard 

The Call Center Dashboard offers a clear view of call center operations, enabling effective monitoring of key performance metrics. I cleaned the data using Excel, applying data modeling, filtering, sorting, formulas, and pivot tables for accuracy.
The dashboard features real-time visualizations and key performance indicators (KPIs) such as average handle time and customer satisfaction ratings. Users can dynamically filter data to customize their analysis.
Overall, this dashboard is a vital tool for optimizing call center performance and enhancing customer service.
